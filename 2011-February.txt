Message-ID: <AANLkTi=zMBtipmN6uWuEipz0QY2KeUdK+Ziz-jCnjAbm@mail.gmail.com>

After over 4 years of silence, I've released my first version of
scmpc-0.3.0. This is a complete rewrite. Here is the list of changes:

- Last.fm Now Playing support
- UNIX domain socket support (mpd 0.14)
- a lot of code cleanup
- mpd idle support (mpd 0.14)
- respect MPD_PORT/MPD_HOST from environment
- support for the Last.fm submission protocol v1.2.1
- new command line option: -k/--kill - kill the running scmpc
